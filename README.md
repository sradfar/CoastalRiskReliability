# Risk and Reliability Analysis in Coastal Engineering Designs

This repository contains materials for the **Risk and Reliability Analysis in Coastal Engineering Designs** short course, developed by **Dr. Soheil Radfar**. The course provides an introduction to probabilistic design, failure probability assessment, and reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) in coastal engineering.

## Topics Covered

- **Risk and Reliability Fundamentals**: Definitions, qualitative and quantitative analysis
- **Probabilistic Design**: Limit state formulation, failure probability, and reliability indices
- **Reliability Methods**:
  - Level I–IV approaches
  - Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS)
  - First-Order Reliability Method (FORM)
- **Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO)**:
  - Problem formulation and solution methods
  - Use of surrogate models for optimization
- **Practical Implementation**:
  - Applications in coastal engineering
  - Introduction to UQLab for reliability analysis
